## Context and Problem Statement

How can users communicate their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a dish or restaurant?

Our application needs to allow users to give restaurants and dishes ratings and reviews so that other users can better find restaurants or meals that suit what they are looking for

## Decision Drivers

* Community-driven suggestions
* Indicates if meal quality matches price

## Considered Options

* Star Ratings
* Hot or Not
* Customer quotes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Star Ratings", 

Our app will allow users to post star ratings beside restaurants and dishes in order to show that they recommend these places and meals. This can be used to show users what people in their area have tried and recommend.

### Positive Consequences 

* lack of written review may prevent abuse
* limit on how many can be placed

### Negative Consequences

* may require moderation to ensure no "review-bombing"
* restaurants may ask for ratings to be changed/updated as dishes are added/removed
